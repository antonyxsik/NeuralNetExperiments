# NeuralNetFromScratch

When learning about machine learning and neural networks, it is a good exercise to write your own neural network using only numpy (no machine learning libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).
Here's mine from a while back, recently updated for Python 3.11! 
I used the classic MNIST handwritten numbers data set, and wrote a simple yet modifiable NN that classifies which number was handwritten in the image.
